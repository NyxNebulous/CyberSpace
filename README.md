CyberSpace

A game where you play inside a futuristic grid city trying to save a dying system! Collect keys, dodge bots, and deliver energy shards back to base to keep the system alive.

How I Made the Map ??
    â€¢ The game world is built using a grid system on HTML5 canvas
    â€¢ The whole canvas is divided into tiles using a fixed tileSize.
    â€¢ Inside each tile, I create a garden area with buildings randomly placed inside.
    â€¢ A special base and a hub are also placed on random tiles â€” but not too close to each other or the edges.
    â€¢ I added towers in most tiles that can damage you if you're in their range. If destroyed, they rebuild over time.
    â€¢ Buildings block movement, towers rotate and attack, and bots move around too.


Controls
    â€¢ W / ArrowUp: Move Up
    â€¢ S / ArrowDown: Move Down
    â€¢ A / ArrowLeft: Move Left
    â€¢ D / ArrowRight: Move Right
    â€¢ Click : Shoot a bouncing bullet in the clicked direction

Objective
    â€¢ Collect 5 keys from around the map.
    â€¢ Go to the hub to convert them into shards.
    â€¢ Return to the base to deliver shards and increase system health.
    â€¢ If system health reaches 100 â†’ YOU WIN!
    â€¢ If system health hits 0 or you die â†’ Game Over.

Towers
    â€¢ Each tile (except base and hub) may have a rotating laser tower.
